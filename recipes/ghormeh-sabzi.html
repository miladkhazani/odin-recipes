<h4>Ghormeh Sabzi is a popular Persian dish that is deeply rooted in Iranian cuisine. It is a flavorful and aromatic stew made with a combination of fresh herbs, primarily parsley, cilantro, and fenugreek leaves, sautéed with onions and cooked with tender chunks of meat, traditionally lamb or beef, and kidney beans. The herbs are finely chopped and cooked down to create a rich and fragrant base, while the meat slowly simmers in the mixture, allowing the flavors to meld together. Ghormeh Sabzi is seasoned with a blend of spices, including turmeric, dried lime, and sometimes saffron, which impart a unique tanginess and depth of flavor. This hearty stew is typically served over steamed basmati rice and accompanied by a side of pickled vegetables. Ghormeh Sabzi is a beloved dish that represents the rich culinary heritage of Iran and is cherished for its comforting taste and cultural significance.</h4>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until deep golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in turmeric for 1 to 2 minutes. Add chuck cubes; cook until coated in turmeric and browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
