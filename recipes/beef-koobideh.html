<h4>Beef Koobideh is a delicious and popular Persian dish that is beloved for its rich flavors and succulent texture. It is a type of kebab made from ground beef that is seasoned with a variety of aromatic herbs and spices. The ground beef is typically mixed with finely chopped onions, garlic, and a blend of spices such as turmeric, cumin, and sumac. The mixture is then shaped into long, cylindrical skewers and grilled to perfection, resulting in juicy and flavorful kebabs. The grilling process imparts a smoky char to the meat while retaining its tenderness. The aromatic spices and herbs infuse the beef with a tantalizing aroma, making each bite a burst of savory goodness. Beef Koobideh is often served with Persian rice, grilled tomatoes, and a side of fresh herbs and yogurt. It is a dish that is enjoyed by people of all ages and is a highlight of Persian cuisine, showcasing the culinary heritage and mastery of flavors in Iranian culture.</h4>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 medium onion, grated and juice squeezed and saved</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef or lamb, 80-85% lean</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt, adjust to your taste</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper, ground</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon onion juice</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
    <li>4 roma tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 green bell peppers, quartered</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Grate the onions and remove the juice by lighting pressing it through a fine mesh sieve. Save the juice for later.
        Place the grated onion in a medium sized mixing bowl and add the remaining ingredients.
    </li>
    <li>Thoroughly knead the mixture for about 5 minutes to create a smooth paste-like consistency. This is a very important step to make sure the meat proteins have been properly bound and to ensure the meat paste will stay on the skewers.
        Place the mixture in the fridge for 30 minutes for proper marination and resting time.
    </li>
    <li>
        If using a charcoal grill, be sure to start the coals about 30 minutes before grilling the Kebabs. If using a gas grill, be sure to have the grill turned on for 15 minutes before grilling to bring the temperature towards 450Â°F. See notes for specific grilling recommendations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Begin by dividing the meat mixture into 4 equal pieces. Each piece will then need to be shaped into a 4-5 inch long oval shaped pieces.
Using the spare onion juice, dampen your hands as necessary and place the oval shaped meat paste against the edge of the wide metal skewers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Slowly stretch and squeeze the meat paste along the skewer until you have a 6-7 inch long Kebab that is roughly 1/2 to 2/3 inch thick.
Make sure to thoroughly squeeze the edges of the meat paste around the skewer to ensure you have a solid piece of kebab that is firmly attached to the skewer.
    </li>
    <li>
        Using your thumb and index finger gently press into the meat mixture to create uniform indentations that are about 1 inch apart. This step creates a traditional design as well as further ensuring the meat paste is firmly pressed into the skewers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place the skewers directly over the flame and flip them within 15 seconds of placing them on the grill. Grill the meat for another 15 seconds before flipping back.
This quick flipping ensures that both sides of the meat begin cooking immediately and ensures the meat stays on the skewer.
    </li>
    <li>
        Grill the Kebabs for about 4 minutes on each side, taking extra care to not over cook them. The Kebabs should be visibly darkened and seared while still remaining juicy on the inside.
    </li>
    <li>
        Baste the Kebabs on both sides shortly before removing them from the grill. Place the skewers on a serving platter.
To remove the Kebabs from the skewer, place a large enough piece of flat bread on one hand and press the kebab out away from you on to the platter.
