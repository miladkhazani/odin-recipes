<h4>Beef Koobideh is a delicious and popular Persian dish that is beloved for its rich flavors and succulent texture. It is a type of kebab made from ground beef that is seasoned with a variety of aromatic herbs and spices. The ground beef is typically mixed with finely chopped onions, garlic, and a blend of spices such as turmeric, cumin, and sumac. The mixture is then shaped into long, cylindrical skewers and grilled to perfection, resulting in juicy and flavorful kebabs. The grilling process imparts a smoky char to the meat while retaining its tenderness. The aromatic spices and herbs infuse the beef with a tantalizing aroma, making each bite a burst of savory goodness. Beef Koobideh is often served with Persian rice, grilled tomatoes, and a side of fresh herbs and yogurt. It is a dish that is enjoyed by people of all ages and is a highlight of Persian cuisine, showcasing the culinary heritage and mastery of flavors in Iranian culture.</h4>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup yellow split peas, rinsed</li>
    <li>3 cups water, adjust as needed</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon turmeric, ground</li>
    <li>1 pound stew beef, 1/2 inch pieces</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
    <li>3 Limu Omani, Persian dried limes, poked through with a paring knife</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon Advieh, Persian spice mix, optional</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground saffron, dissolved in 2 tablespoons water</li>
    <li>2 large yukon gold potatoes, peeled and sliced to resemble french fries</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a small pot bring the yellow split peas and water to a gentle boil. Keep an eye on the pot as yellow split peas produce lots of foam and can spill over.
    </li>
    <li>Once boiling, partially cover and simmer on low heat for about 15 minutes. The yellow split peas are partially cooked at this stage and will continue to cook further once integrated into the stew. Remove from the heat, strain and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
        Saute the onions with oil in a large pot over medium heat for 15 minutes,
Add turmeric and saute for an additional 2 minutes. The onions should be golden in color and aromatic at this stage.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the beef pieces to the onions and increase the flame to medium-high and saute for about 5 minutes.
Continue by adding the tomato paste and saute for a couple of minutes on medium heat to bring out the flavor of the tomato paste.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add 1 1/2 cups of water, cover, and cook for 45 minutes over low heat.
Continue by adding the Limu Omani, salt, pepper, Advieh, and sugar to the stew. Stir and simmer for 20 minutes.
Gently stir in the partially cooked yellow split peas, and continue to simmer on low heat for 15 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        While the meat is cooking, toss the potatoes with oil, salt, and turmeric and place single-layered on a baking sheet.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place the potatoes in a 375Â°F oven and roast for about 30 minutes, or until golden and crispy. I prefer to use a convection oven to roast the potatoes to a golden perfection without having to flip the potatoes over. If not using convection, be sure to flip the potatoes once.

    </li>
    <li>
        Check the stew to ensure the meat is fully cooked and tender while the majority of the yellow split peas are still holding their shape.
        Add the saffron-water and gently mix.
    </li>
    <li>
        The stew should be slightly tart and dense with ingredients, but not too dry or runny with liquid. Adjust as needed.
Take the stew off the heat, and allow to set for 10 minutes.

    </li>
    <li>Place the stew in a serving bowl and top with the crispy golden potatoes and serve with Persian saffron basmati rice.</li>
